                  What you pay depends on how much work your goals actually need. Final pricing
                  depends on project scope and requirements, and we agree the exact number with
                  you before any work begins.

                  On the Growth and Scale plans, what you spend with Meta or Google on advertising
                  is separate from our fee. Our fee covers planning and running those campaigns.
